#My first project using HTML and CSS for The Odin Project.

It was very challenging, the previously held courses were only based on the reproduction of a controlled environment of markings and design.

I learn the sense of how to study because the reproduction of a website is really not easy, I liked the challenge.

My following expectations:

- Advance understanding of both HTML, CSS, and Javascript;
- Exercise autonomy and creativity in reproductions and new projects.

#I'm dedicating myself every day, towards excellence!
